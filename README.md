quiet stable and helpful as expected .

you can down load the python file and the font and replace them at same directory ob your own pc and try runing the code,
the result will be generating new image to the same directory that is a math test with radom question on it.

Notice: every time you run the code it generates different test with new different math operations that's the good part here.

you can edit the code to your own needs xD.
